this document has the proposed recipe logic items and their descriptions

clear terms....
meat temp-optional meat temp probes
grill temp-internal grill temp
timer- it counts down



use one grill temp probe for set temp
use average of both grill temp probes for set temp
use less or more of either grill temp probes for set temp
compensate grill temp for ambient temp or amb pressure(requested vs target compensation)

timer till next recipe step
timer or meat temp first to next step
timer and meat temp then next step

OR set meat temp till next step
BOTH set meat temp till next step

next step at clock time? where do we get a stable clock? gps, time server, preset? battery powered on board RTC?




error handling.

what if next step depends on meat probe and we lose the meat probe (shorted,broken or unplugged)....... options are to maintain, stop, maintain and sound alarm etc
