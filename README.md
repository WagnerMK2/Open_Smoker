an open source pellet grill controller

i intend this to be an open source pellet grill controller.
it will either be a raspberry pi hat and or stand alone board.
the pi hat and or stand alone board will be easy to make with just a soldering iron.
the software will be open and have options and or modules you can choose to extend the funtionality.

make the board cusomizable to each persons chosen needs to assemble.
if you want 1 meat probe, populate onle one meat probe circuit. then select software and compile firmware.

i want to have recipe instructions that are very generous in options.
think if this then that options
I.E. if either meat probe hits 170*f then move on a step.

id like to use temp sensors that are from popular grill brands and maybe some that are industru=ial in nature so that they are easy to procure. probably use k type connectors for the grill temp probes and the 3.5mm jack style for the meat temp probes
should look into sourcing silicon temp probe gromments for the grill body.
