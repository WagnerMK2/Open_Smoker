an open source pellet grill controller

i intend this to be an open source pellet grill controller.
it will either be a raspberry pi hat and or stand alone board.
the pi hat and or stand alone board will be easy to make with just a soldering iron.
the software will be open and have options and or modules you can choose to extend the funtionality.
